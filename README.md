## Backed by Science

Our project is informed by scientific research on the benefits of mindful breathing for stress and anxiety reduction. A comprehensive review of 58 clinical studies, published in the journal *Brain Sciences*, found that breathing practices can be incredibly effective in reducing stress and anxiety when done correctly [1]. 

**Here's what the science says about creating an effective breathing practice:**

*   Avoid breathing exercises that only involve fast breathing.
*   Practice for at least 5 minutes per session.
*   Include some form of instruction or guidance, especially when you're first learning.
*   Make it a regular habit - practice multiple times and over a longer period for optimal benefits.

**We're incorporating these findings into our project to help you maximize the benefits of mindful breathing.**
