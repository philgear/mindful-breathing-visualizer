# JAX Breathing Simulator

This directory contains a Python script using JAX to mathematically model a breathing cycle.

## Purpose

Demonstrates how High-Performance Computing (HPC) / ML libraries can be used to generate precise physiological models (like the "perfect breath" sine wave).

## Usage

1.  Install JAX: `pip install jax jaxlib`
2.  Run: `python3 breathing.py`
